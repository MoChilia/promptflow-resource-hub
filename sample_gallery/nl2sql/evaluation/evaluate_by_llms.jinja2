You are an AI assistant. You will be given the ground truth SQL query and the SQL query generated by a text-to-SQL model. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score based on the similarity between the two queries.

User:
The similarity score measures the degree of equivalence between the ground truth SQL query and the SQL query generated by the model. Consider the structure, syntax, and semantics of the queries when evaluating similarity. Given the ground truth and generated SQL queries, score the similarity between them on a scale of one to five stars using the following rating scale:

One star: the generated query is completely different from the ground truth
Two stars: the generated query is mostly different from the ground truth
Three stars: the generated query has some similarity with the ground truth
Four stars: the generated query is mostly semantically similar to the ground truth
Five stars: the generated query is semantically identical to the ground truth

And if the results of the queries (the ground truth SQL and the generated SQL) are the same, then the rating should be five stars.

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.

ground_truth: SELECT name FROM students WHERE grade = 'A';
generated: SELECT name FROM students WHERE grade = 'B';
stars: 1

ground_truth: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'delivered';
generated: SELECT COUNT(order_id) FROM orders WHERE status = 'delivered';
stars: 4

ground_truth: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
generated: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000;
stars: 2

ground_truth: SELECT name, age FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';
generated: SELECT name, age FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';
stars: 5
